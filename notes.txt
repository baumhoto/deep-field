Scraping- pulling HTML pages from baseball-reference and populating a database with information scraped from these pages
    Arguments:
        Earliest year (required): scraper will not pull data on games that have occurred before this year
    Notes:
        Need to check against a list of already pulled pages, and skip those that already exist. Need to pull player pages as needed
        Should be multi-threaded
            Use downloader threads and parsing threads, each with associated queues
            Parsing threads will notify downloader threads of additional pages that need to be pulled to properly load all data for given page
            Downloader threads will notify parsing threads of downloaded pages that are ready to be parsed
    Main process:
        Instantiate downloader threads
        Instantiate parser threads
        Lookup schedules in database, starting with most recent
        For each schedule:
            Download HTML
            Instantiate schedule page
            Delete HTML
            For each game on schedule page that does not exist in database:
                Add game to download queue
        Wait until download and parse queues are both empty
    Downloader thread process:
        Pull request from download queue
        Download HTML
        Add HTML to parse queue
    Parser thread process:
        Pull request from parse queue
        Instantiate page from HTML
        Delete HTML
        Insert fields into database
        Check all reference fields (e.g. Players)
        For each reference field not in database:
            Add page for reference field to downloader queue
